[![Build](https://github.com/Orel6505/EventsManager/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=22may)](https://github.com/Orel6505/EventsManager/actions/workflows/build.yml)
## In Short
The idea for this project came to me one time after I worked as a waiter in Kfar Habad.

I thought to myself how much time my managers spent selling events at his hall frontally. This project came to simplify that.
